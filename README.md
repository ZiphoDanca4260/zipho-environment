1. **Major version (0)** - This number changes when there are significant updates that make the new version incompatible with previous versions. Such changes usually include architectural modifications, significant enhancements, or backward-incompatible changes to the application stacks, infrastructure, or exposed network interfaces.

2. **Minor version (1)** - This number increments when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner. This typically includes the addition of new components like user interfaces (UI), application programming interfaces (API), databases, or the like, while still maintaining the existing architecture.

3. **Feature version (0)** - This number updates when there are smaller, backward-compatible enhancements or changes to existing components, such as improvements to the UI, API, database, optimizations, or new features that don't change the overall architecture of the system.

4. **Build/Revision number (1)** - This is the least significant number and is often used to denote successive builds or advancements of the software across all the previous version phases. It includes routine bug fixes, minor enhancements, hotfixes post-production releases, and other incremental changes. This number often reflects the build process itself, and in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments, it commonly indicates the number of commits or builds since the last significant release.
